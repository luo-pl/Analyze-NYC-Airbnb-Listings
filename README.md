Introduction
------------
This GitHub repository has the code related to a Google Slides that you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lIauAHuCXiUlKSzYsG-ndRId-xe_NQfKoCiYNatb-tk/edit#slide=id.gffea5f6592_0_77).

This project aims to analyze the data from New York City Airbnb dataset, available in this [link](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), and answer the following questions:

* How does the revenue generated per Airbnb listing compare to traditional long-term rentals in New York City?
* What is the overall revenue potential for hosts managing multiple Airbnb listings in the city?
* What are the key considerations and strategies for investors to maximize returns?
